# Code Retreat

We're pairing in 45 minute sessions.

## 4 Principals to Focus On

- Small
- DRY
- Well Named
- Tested

## Schedule of Day

- Length of Session: 45 minutes
- Duration: 8.30am to 5 or 6pm
Pair-programming is necessary, as the knowledge transfer contained in that - activity is essential to the practice
- Prefer using Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- After each session, pairs should be swapped
- After each session, code must be deleted, not put in a branch, not stashed, just deleted with no trace left
- After each session the group convenes for a retrospective and break
